This repository contains a **Mini RPG Battle Simulator**, developed as part of an assignment for the **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** course in the **Computer Science** program at **Centro Universit√°rio Bar√£o de Mau√°**, under the guidance of professor **Eliza Maria da Cunha Bomfim**.

The project was created using **Java** with a focus on applying **Object-Oriented Programming** principles while building an interactive battle system.

## üè∞ Project Overview
The game allows players to engage in strategic battles while managing their kingdom. The main features include:
